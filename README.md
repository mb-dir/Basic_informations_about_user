# What can I get from you?

Simple application that aims to show how much information is in the browser/software designer can get from user.

## Motivation

I wanted to create project like that in order to realize about amount of informations which browser has "inside".

## What I use?

I use my own [webpack boilerplate](https://github.com/mb-dir/webpack_basic_template), git as a Version Control System and data from browser.
